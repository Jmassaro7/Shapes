# Shapes
A project created for my Problem Solving and Programming II course during my sophomore year

This program allows users to add 2D and 3D shapes and perform options such as displaying shape information from a menu. The mathmatical formulas for calculating area, perimeter, volume, surface area, etc are contained within each shape class.
